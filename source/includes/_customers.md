|--------- Important points to create new customers ----------|

1 . First there are two ways to import customer in the application


      i)  Import customer while syncing from eThor .

      ii) User has a facility to register themself as a customer .

      iii)  When user register on application , they are required to fill the various fields such as : first name , last name , birth date , email address , password ,phone code , phone number ,password_confirmation .

      iv) Email address , password , phone code , phone number are the mandatory fields

      v) If customer with particular details are not present on the eThor , then it will also create the customer on eThor also .

      vi) Every customer has unique customer id on eThor , whenever a customer registration is done ,customer is also create on the eThor on background and once the customer is created on ethor , it will return the customer ID as (pos_customer_id) and save this ID in customer table .

      vi) In case customer register themself on application , and if customer is already present on the eThor , then it will return their unique customer id and save in the application's database .

      vii) Every customer can be associated with one or more restaurant at a time ,
